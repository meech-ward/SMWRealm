### Your First Code Contribution

#### Forking

To make any code contributions, you'll have to fork this repo and keep your version synced with this repo. Read [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) if you need some help getting started.

#### Branching

We are using *[A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)* so make sure you always sync your repo from the `develop` branch and when you're done, pull request back into the `develop` branch. This makes it easier to organize code, update changelogs, and add tags and version numbers.

When you want to start coding, create a new `feature` branch off of the `develop` branch. You should name this banch `feature/name-of-feature`.

#### Writing Code

Before writing any code or making any commits, make sure to check out the [Styleguides](styleguides) section of this document.

Use TDD and make sure that all code has test coverage. 

Copy the style of code used in project. That goes for writing tests and production code. I should not be able to test your code apart from mine or anyone else's.

#### Pull Requests

Once you have completed you're code. Pull request your code into the `develop` branch of this repo.
